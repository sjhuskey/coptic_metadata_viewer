      "So the plan is to find the frbr:Work instance with the title 'Sermo asceticus', then get its dcterms:creator, which should be the author. But wait, the frbr:Work has a dcterms:title property. So I need to look for frbr:Work where dcterms:title is 'Sermo asceticus'. Then, get the dcterms:creator of that work, which is an instance of coptic:Author. Then, maybe get the foaf:name of that author to get the name.\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, the coptic:Author is a subclass of dcterms:Agent, and dcterms:Agent has a foaf:name property. So the author's name would be via foaf:name.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the steps are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Find all frbr:Work instances where dcterms:title is 'Sermo asceticus'.\n",
      "2. For each such work, get its dcterms:creator (which is an Author).\n",
      "3. For each Author, get their foaf:name to get the name.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I need to make sure that the query uses the correct properties and classes. Also, the schema mentions that frbr:Work has a dcterms:title, so that's the property to use for the title.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the SPARQL query would start with selecting the foaf:name where the work's title is 'Sermo asceticus'.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me structure the query:\n",
      "\n",
      "SELECT ?authorName WHERE {\n",
      "  ?work a frbr:Work ;\n",
      "        dcterms:title \"Sermo asceticus\" .\n",
      "  ?work dcterms:creator ?author .\n",
      "  ?author a coptic:Author ;\n",
      "          foaf:name ?authorName .\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but the dcterms:creator is an object property from frbr:Work to coptic:Author. So the ?work's dcterms:creator is ?author, which is an instance of coptic:Author. Then, the author's foaf:name is the name.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I need to check if the foaf:name is directly on the coptic:Author or if it's through dcterms:Agent. Since coptic:Author is a subclass of dcterms:Agent, and dcterms:Agent has foaf:name as a property. So the author (which is a coptic:Author) would have foaf:name as a property.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the query should work. Also, need to include the necessary prefixes. The user mentioned to include all necessary PREFIX declarations. The prefixes include dcterms, foaf, frbr, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the final SPARQL query would be:\n",

      "SELECT ?authorName WHERE {\n",
      "  ?work a frbr:Work ;\n",
      "        dcterms:title \"Sermo asceticus\" .\n",
      "  ?work dcterms:creator ?author .\n",

      "          foaf:name ?authorName .\n",
      "}\n",

      "But wait, the schema says that dcterms:creator is an object property from frbr:Work to coptic:Author. So the ?work's dcterms:creator is ?author, which is an instance of coptic:Author. Then, the ?author has foaf:name as a property. So that's correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also check if there are any other properties or classes that might be involved. For example, maybe the author is a foaf:Person? But according to the schema, coptic:Author is a subclass of dcterms:Agent, and dcterms:Agent is a class. The foaf:Person is a separate class, but the schema doesn't mention a direct link between coptic:Author and foaf:Person. However, the foaf:Person has a dcterms:identifier and foaf:name. But the query is about the name, so if the author is a foaf:Person, then foaf:name would be the right property. However, the schema says that coptic:Author is a subclass of dcterms:Agent, and dcterms:Agent has foaf:name as a property. So the author (as a coptic:Author) would have foaf:name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the author is a foaf:Person. But the schema doesn't explicitly state that. However, the schema does have foaf:Person as a class, and dcterms:Agent is a class. The coptic:Author is a subclass of dcterms:Agent. So the author could be a foaf:Person if that's part of the hierarchy, but the schema doesn't specify that. So perhaps the correct approach is to use foaf:name on the coptic:Author.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the schema's foaf:Person has a foaf:name property. However, the coptic:Author is a subclass of dcterms:Agent, which is a class. The dcterms:Agent has a foaf:name property. So the author (as a coptic:Author) would have foaf:name as a property. Therefore, the query is correct.\n",

      "So the final SPARQL query should be as above. Also, need to include the necessary prefixes. The user mentioned to include all necessary PREFIX declarations. The prefixes include dcterms, foaf, frbr, etc. So the query should have the correct prefixes.\n",
