The user asked who wrote ""Sermo asceticus"". I have the task to generate a response based on SPARQL query results without adding any external knowledge.First, I need to check if there's information provided in the context about this specific work and its author. Looking at the given info: it mentions an author with URI http://paths.uniroma1.it/atlas/authors/11, but that doesn't directly relate to ""Sermo asceticus"". The user might be expecting a direct answer linking the title to the author.Since there's no explicit connection between ""Sermo asceticus"" and the mentioned author in the information provided, I can't confirm it. But maybe the URI is part of a dataset where authors are linked to their works. However, without that specific data point, I shouldn't assume anything. The user could be testing if I rely on external knowledge or stick strictly to given info. They might want to ensure that my response doesn't include facts not present in the provided information. Also, they might need accurate citation details for academic purposes, so precision is key here.I should respond clearly stating that based on the available data, no author has been identified for ""Sermo asceticus"". This avoids any incorrect assumptions and adheres to the instructions of only using the given info without doubt.</think>Based on the provided information, I cannot identify who wrote 'Sermo asceticus'.",,21.298722743988037
